# Sudoku-Group-T

This is a computer science 102 project aimed at producing a Sudoku application. There was an error in the first repository and we had to recreate it on the 09/10/2022.
We are unable to gather who did what work as a result. The original repository including the .java can be found at https://github.com/TaigueM/Group-T-Sudoku.
