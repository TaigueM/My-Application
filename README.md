# Sudoku-Group-T

This is a computer science 102 project aimed at producing a Sudoku application. There was an error in the first repository and we had to recreate it on the 09/10/2022.
We are unable to gather who did what work as a result. The original repository including the .java can be found at https://github.com/TaigueM/Group-T-Sudoku.

Aim: Computer Science Project 2022 aims to create a sudoku game.

Instructions for use:  click on the empty spaces to fill in the number.  As you are clicking the numbers, they increase from 1 to 9. You will stop clicking when you get to the number that you think is suitable to win the game. The player has to click the start button to start the game. Rules button will help the player to read and understand how the game works, including the things that might make the game not playable, like repeating the number in the same row. The how to play button displays a message, more like an instruction that will help the player to solve the board. The player can press the back button to exit the game.  The game can be accessed using the link and run it on Android Studio by pressing the run button on the top right.

Tool used: The AndroidManifest.xml and Android studio.

Concepts used: Compiler.xml file. Misc.xml file was also used and it contains the local environment specific information, it is located in the .idea folder. vcs.xml file that is also located in the .idea folder and it contains all vcs related information.The build gradle which generates the apk from .java and xml files in this project. The build gradle is located in the app folder in the repository. The build gradle has dependences which are build for this project. Puzzle.txt was used in the main code, it has the default board values written. 

Assumptions: At the start of the game, a grid will be constructed. The 'Blue' colored numerals represent the board's default values. The board may be accessed by tapping on the blank or "black" colored numbers, and the number will rise (up to 9) until the player is happy with the number presented. The game will offer feedback on whether or not the board is filled and whether or not it is right. When the board is correct, the player is alerted that the board is finished.


Limitations: The program cannot run if the board is incorrectly filled.
